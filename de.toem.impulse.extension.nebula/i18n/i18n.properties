instancer.description = Adds a new Xy Chart (Nebula). XY diagrams draw two groups of numbers as a set of XY coordinates. XY diagrams show the relationship of two records.
instancer.label = Xy Chart (Nebula)
instancer.description.0 = Adds a new Intensity Chart (Nebula). An intensity diagram represents the input data as colored dots in a cartesian plane (e.g. for the representation of temperature patterns). 
instancer.label.0 = Intensity Chart (Nebula)
instancer.description.1 = Adds a new Eye Chart (Nebula). An eye diagram is an oscilloscope display in which a digital signal is repeatedly sampled by a receiver and applied to the vertical input while the data rate is used to trigger the horizontal sweep.
instancer.label.1 = Eye Chart (Nebula)
