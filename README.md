# impulse
impulse is a powerful waveform viewer and analyser tool, helping engineers to comfortably understand and debug complex semiconductor and multi-core software systems.
It allows the representation of a wide range of signals, and is not limited to digital and analogue signals only. Beside these two types, impulse offers transaction, event, text, log, structured, binary, image and multi-dimensional signals, supporting impressive visualization options.

All impulse components are fully integrated into the eclipse framework (Windows, Linux and OSX/Mac) and can be combined with a growing set of emerging eclipse technologies and extensions (IoT, language IDEs, reports, CM... ).

Developed to be user-friendly, impulse offers an intuitive, enjoyable and efficient path into your design domain.
impulse is not just a dedicated solution for a specific environment; it is an enabler for a wide range of domains, helping you to visualize and analyse your target in your very specific environment, open to everything and adaptable to different environments.
